 a bright maximum aperture and provides an ultra wide-angle view with 
the shortest focal length in the line-up of L-series lenses. Its 
diagonal angle of view is an impressive 114° - anything larger would be a
 fisheye lens.,This lens features completely redesigned 
optics, including two high-precision Aspherical elements and two 
UD-glass elements. This results in better contrast and sharpness at the 
outer edges, and a reduction in chromatic aberrations that can sometimes
 be seen with high-resolution digital SLRs. Its minimum focus distance 
is 7.9"" and its truly circular diaphragm helps to create a pleasing 
out-of-focus background.,The 14mm f/2.8L II USM lens uses a rear 
focusing system, high-speed CPU, and a ring-type ultrasonic autofocus 
motor (USM) with revised electronics for faster, more responsive and 
quiet AF. Manual focus override allows for precise manual focus even in 
AF mode.,This wide aperture lens is the ideal choice for 
architectural, wedding, or other pro-level photography applications and 
its moisture proof and dustproof sealing helps to ensure its durability.,

Three aspherical lens elements (one glass-molded and two replica surfaces) efficiently compensate for aberration fluctuations over the entire zoom range while enabling a large f/2.8 aperture and high image quality. Two UD lenses also reduce secondary chromatic aberrations to produce high-resolution, high-contrast images without colour aberration bleeding around subject edges. The inner focus and a ring-type USM achieve silent, high-speed autofocusing, while full-time manual focus override offers excellent operability by enabling users to tweak focusing without exiting the autofocusing mode. Now it's easier to determine the ideal focus when shooting portrait and close-up photos with a large aperture setting. A circular aperture diaphragm contributes to beautiful background blur, and the optimized lens configuration and coating reduce the flare and ghost so common with digital cameras. This outstanding optical performance and operability is further enhanced by an Image Stabilizer that reduces the amount of camera-shake blur to roughly that of a 3 f-stop faster shutter speed*1. Clearly, this standard zoom lens meets the stringent requirements of professionals. The lens mechanism is designed to ensure that it fits only EOS DIGITAL SLR cameras designed to take EF-S lenses, and it is equipped with a special attachment indicator and protective rubber mount ring to prevent mistaken attempts to attach it to other EOS SLR cameras, and to prevent damage to the camera body.,Filter size: 77mm,Max aperture: f/2.8,With ring USM motor and IS"

By virtue of its precisely ground aspherical lens, which adeptly compensates for spherical aberrations and other distortions, this lens displays exquisite detail and high contrast even at f/1.2. And with the incorporation of a floating lens mechanism, aberration fluctuations are substantially reduced at short and medium distance shots to ensure extremely sharp, quality images consistently at all shooting distances. We have also dramatically sped up AF performance in response to requests from professionals. A faster CPU and optimized AF algorithm allow the lens to focus instantaneously for reliable capture of fleeting photo opportunities. This lens is even more pleasant to use for portrait work because of the very shallow depth of field at f/1.2, coupled with full-time manual focusing for fine adjustment.,Furthermore, Canon effectively reduced the flaring and ghosting common with digital cameras by optimizing internal lens placement and coatings. A circular aperture is also used to maximize the wonderful defocusing attributes of the lens at the maximum f/1.2 aperture. All told, this is the one lens that can meet the toughest demands of professional photographers, whether shooting female portraits with a masterful blur effect or natural scenes in natural lighting.,Filter size: 72mm,Max aperture: f/1.2,With ring USM motor"

This lens allows photographers to achieve the reach of a super-telephoto lens, while maintaining superior standards of mobility in the lens through a portable and lightweight form factor. While traditional telephoto lenses are designed with gaps between the optical elements to reduce chromatic aberration, the EF400mm f/4 DO IS II USM uses a gapless dual-layered diffractive optical element, which greatly reduces the ring-shaped diffractive flaring caused by high-intensity light sources. This reduction is taken further with the incorporation of a large diameter ground aspherical lens and a UD lens. ,It also contains an improved IS unit that significantly enhances image stabilization when the appropriate IS mode is selected and features a shorter minimum focal distance, down to 3.3m from 3.5m in its predecessor. Maximum magnification has also improved from 0.12x to 0.13x as a result of the superior lens characteristics. The EF400mm f/4 DO IS II USM is highly resistant to harsh environments. This is achieved through a fluorine coating on both the front and rear lens elements, which makes the lens dirt and oil-resistant while easier to clean. All rings and buttons are constructed with a dust and drip-proof structure, preventing dust and liquid from entering the sensitive interior of the lens.,Filter size: 52mm drop-in,Max aperture: f/4,With Ring–type USM and IS"

Despite the roughly 5x large magnification zoom, the lens size itself is very compact, thanks to use of a compact EMD and a multi-group zoom system, which means this lens works well in fast-moving photographic situations. The optical system uses glass-mold aspherical lenses. Suppressing the curvature of field, spherical aberration, and other distortions common in long focal lengths over the whole zoom range and correcting for other aberrations makes for sharp picture quality. The autofocus is quick and quiet thanks to the ring-type USM and inner focusing system. The full-time manual focus, non-rotating front lens element, and wide zoom ring make the lens a dream to use.

The Nikon version produces a diagonal angle of view of 180 degrees (154 degrees for Sigma, 167 degrees for Canon). The diagonal field of view of this fisheye lens produces striking images with exaggerated perspective and distortion. The minimum focusing distance of 13.5cm and maximum magnification 1:3.3 allows subjects to be as close as 1.8cm from the lens front element. This close focusing capability allows close-up photography and also it is possible to make use of large depth of field that covers wide range of subjects. The Integral hood blocks out extraneous light and the super multi-layer coating minimizes flare and ghosting, creating superior image quality. The HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) ensures fast and quiet auto focusing and allows full-time manual focus override by rotation of the focus ring. This lens is supplied with a gelatin filter holder at the rear, allowing the use of gelatin filters."
